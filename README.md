# Accieo
Navigation Application for Differently Abled

Disability is about people and their social relationships, and as such it is about the life of people with disabilities and their interaction with the community and the environment.

Accieo has an intuitive interface that facilitates the user to locate the accessible locations that fall on his/her route and enumerates the facilities available at each of these locations. The app is designed on the crowd-source model which invites user to mark places with no available data as 'accessible', 'inaccessible' or 'partially accessible' buildings.

The app provides an integrated database management system which assists the user by already providing the feasible traveling locations. Often, a disabled person has to suffer the indignity of not being able to gain admittance to a place because of his physical disability. This not merely damages a personâ€™s self-esteem but also, contributes in isolating him from the society as after a series of such incidents, they shy away from travelling outside unless absolutely necessary. This app, while contributing in keeping track of the development of accessible infrastructure in a place, also may save a People with Disability from suffering the aforesaid embarrassment and agony by providing him the possibilities beforehand.
